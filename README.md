# inverse_robot_design
This is the source code of Chenda Duan's research on inverse design of soft robots. All the codes and images can be reproduced using the file in this repo.
-forward_withoutlossmodified: To reproduce the figure 2 in the report, where the prediction is not accurate at the boundary, when we use default loss function.
-forward_withlossmodified: To reproduce the figure 3 in the report, where the prediction is accurate at the boundary after modifying the loss function.
-compare_result_forward: The forward training model of experiment part
-compare_result: The backward optimizer in of the experiment part, and generate figure 4.
Note: You might need to change some of the path in the file.
